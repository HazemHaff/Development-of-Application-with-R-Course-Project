Johns Hopkins University Data Science: Shiny App Project

*Overview:

This repository contains my project submission for the Data Science specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera. The project involves the development of a demonstration application using R Shiny, hosted on shinyapps.io, and an accompanying presentation hosted on RPubs. The primary aim of this project is educational, demonstrating the skills I've acquired in the Data Science program.

*Project Components:

Shiny Application: An interactive web application built using R Shiny for exploring car datasets. This application allows users to visualize different aspects of car data through dynamic, user-driven plots.
Presentation Slides: A set of slides created with R Markdown and ioslides, showcasing the features and technical aspects of the Shiny application.

*Running the Application Locally:

To run the application locally:

1.Clone this repository to your local machine.

2.Open the project in RStudio.

3.Make sure to have all the required R packages installed (listed in the server.R and ui.R files).

4.Create your own rsconnect credentials to deploy the app to your shinyapps.io account.

5.Replace the "secret" in the rconnect.R script with your corresponding credentials.


*About the Data:

The application utilizes the "mtcars" dataset, providing an interactive way to explore various characteristics of cars, such as fuel consumption, horsepower, and other attributes.
